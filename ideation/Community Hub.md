The basic idea behind Community Hub is to create a hyperlocal social media platform that is exclusively available to the people who reside in a specific city or town. Residents would be encouraged to discuss issues that matter to their community, local businesses would be approached to advertise to those residents, and local arts, events, and news would be highly visible on the site. Essentially, it should become a place that residents of a community want to check once a day to get their fix of local news and conversation.

A project of this scale has many different components, and each of those will be explored in these pages. Nothing here is set in stone - it's purely a place to think about all of the possible solutions to the hard problems that underlie the project.
