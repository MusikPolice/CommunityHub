Broadly defined as any information about a user that may personally identify them. 

The nature of the proposed platform requires collection and storage of each user's name, email address, phone number, and mailing address. This information needs to be stored in a safe manner that is compliant with all Canadian laws. Ideally, each user controls which other users can see this data, this data is encrypted at rest, and users have a means of closing their accounts, at which time this data is purged from active [[Datastores]].
