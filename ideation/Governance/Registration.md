Registering to join Community Hub should be relatively painless, but some friction is necessary to prevent bad behaviour.

The registration process should require new users to enter a valid email address and a display name. Users should also be encouraged to enter a phone number that can receive text messages, as well as their mailing address. 

The provided email address can be immediately verified through [standard means](Email). A text message [can be sent](SMS) to verify the phone number. [[Letter mail]] can be sent for the purposes of [[Mailing Address Validation]]. Each level of verification will increase the user's [[Trust Score]].
