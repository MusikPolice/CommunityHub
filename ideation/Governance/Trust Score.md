How well known a user is. A higher trust score equates to more permissions. A lower trust score equates to more restrictions and friction.

A user's trust score could be recorded as a signed integer value, with positive actions incrementing the value and negative actions decrementing the value. The trust score can be [normalized against all other user scores](https://www.statology.org/normalize-data-between-0-and-100/) for display and authorization purposes. The [empirical rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule) can be used to determine the subsets of users that are truly exceptional or problematic, relative to their peers.

Users with a higher trust score should be afforded more privileges, and their feedback should be given more weight than those with a lower trust score. As an example, if threads or comments within threads can be voted up or down, then the value of a user's vote can be multiplied by their normalized trust score to determine the weighted value of their vote. In this way, the votes and attention of users that are strong advocates for their community will carry more weight than those who are new to the platform or who do not contribute in a positive manner.
