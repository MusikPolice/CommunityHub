One potential revenue source for the platform is geographically targeted local advertising. Developing [runtime metrics](<Runtime Metrics>) that show how many users from each neighborhood are served an ad impression can help to demonstrate the value of advertising on the platform. This kind of advertising is probably only valuable to locally owned and operated independent businesses who value traffic from people that live near their locations.

In lieu of actual ads, showing fake ads that are funny or satirical could be a lighthearted way to reserve space in the UI and to demonstrate the value of that space to potential advertisers.

The platform should never show generic Google or Meta ads, and must always hold advertisers to a high standard of quality. Ads must always be valuable to members of our community.

Discussions with local business owners about what they would need to see in order to buy in to an advertising campaign on a platform like this will help to inform this effort.
