Verifying a user's home address requires letter mail to be sent and received. 

[Canada Post's find a rate tool](https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/cpc/en/tools/find-a-rate.page) puts the cost of mailing two standard sheets of paper in an envelope at $1.63. In 2021, Statistics Canada estimated [the number of private dwellings in Kitchener](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&DGUIDlist=2021S0503541&GENDERlist=1&STATISTIClist=1&HEADERlist=0&form=MG0AV3) to be 219,000. Sending a letter to every potential user who wants to join the platform could become a key driver of operating costs.

[Canada Post also supports bulk letter mailing at $1.23/piece](https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/cpc/en/small-business/bulk-prepaid-digital/letter-discounts.page).

It may be cheaper to send letter mail in bulk via a third party service like [a postage machine](https://mail.quadient.com/en/postage-meters-mailing-systems).
