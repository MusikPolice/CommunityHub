Every good forum needs good content to keep people engaged and interested in coming back. Seeding the conversation with links to local content could help to make the platform feel alive when users are few, and establish it as a destination for local news and events once things start moving.

As a rule, crawlers should always link out to sites rather than copying their content (aside of course from the metadata and image exposed by [the OpenGraph protocol](https://opengraph.dev/)). This ensures that the platform is respecting authors' content, driving traffic to the source, and avoids disrupting the ad revenue of the source site.

Some crawlers to consider:
- Local news websites
- Substack newsletters maintained by local citizens and journalists
- Press releases and news feeds distributed by municipal governments
- Social media posts from select local celebrities, politicians, and businesspeople
