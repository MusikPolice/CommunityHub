The obvious choices for hosting providers would be one of the big three cloud computing companies: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. All present a similar feature set, and if the underlying technology is open source and portable, the platform should run equally well on any of them.

Another less obvious option would be to make use of a smaller hosting provider that may provide fewer services at a cheaper cost.

A third possibility for a relatively small site is to build a bespoke server to accommodate initial iterations of the project, only migrating to cloud hosting if/when traffic increases beyond the limits of a home internet connection.

This decision will very likely be influenced by the chosen tech stack and how well the project can be optimized.
## todo
- Research hosting costs for each of the big three providers
- Research hosting costs for a range of smaller, more lightweight providers
- Attempt to determine what is possible on dedicated hardware
