## DevOps
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for describing infrastructure like datastores, compute nodes, and credentials
	- [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) is a Terraform fork that is managed by The Linux Foundation
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) if/when multiple services need to be orchestrated, and/or multiple instances of a service need to be distributed across logical nodes
## Backend
- Kotlin and Spring Framework are the obvious choices for me, as they are technologies that I am intimately familiar with, and that will let me move quickly
- JetBrains maintains what appears to be a Spring Framework competitor called [ktor](https://start.ktor.io/settings) that should be investigated
	- ktor [appears to be able to serve static html pages](https://ktor.io/docs/server-create-website.html), potentially allowing for a single repository to be used for both backend and front end
## Web Interface
I'm drawing a blank here. I know next to nothing about front-end development, so this will be a learning experience for me.
